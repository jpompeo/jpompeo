Hi all! My name is Joanna.  
I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer currently looking for opportunities in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. Right now I'm working on building out features for a goal-tracking application I designed for writers, using React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. You can view the code in my writing-app repository or [checkout my demo of it here](https://demo-day.projectshift.io/joanna/). If you'd like to connect, feel free to [contact me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-pompeo/)
